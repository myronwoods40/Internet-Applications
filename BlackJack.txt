#BlackJack.py

Object of this code is to create a black jack python game. The code uses “cgi” and “sqlite” to create a web game. “CGI” is used to make web applications and we can write our HTML directly into the python file. The second, “sqlite”, will used to interface with a database. We need the database so we can keep track of what cards have been used after the user refreshes the page.  So, the code creates a data base named “deck”.  Then this is followed by a series of functions. These functions are responsible for interacting with the deck.  We need to assign each card in the deck a picture and a value. Then the main function is responsible for the logic of the black jack game.
